# Unsupervised-Learning

## **Overview**
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is given **unlabeled data** and learns patterns, relationships, or structures without predefined categories. Unlike supervised learning, which relies on labeled training data, unsupervised learning algorithms work independently to uncover hidden structures within the dataset.

### **Common Applications of Unsupervised Learning:**
- **Clustering** – Customer segmentation, image classification, document grouping
- **Dimensionality Reduction** – Feature selection, noise reduction, visualization
- **Anomaly Detection** – Fraud detection, network security, medical diagnosis
- **Association Rule Learning** – Market basket analysis, recommendation systems
- **Density Estimation** – Probability distribution modeling, generative modeling

## **Key Concepts and Techniques**  

### **1. Clustering: Grouping Similar Data Points Together**
Clustering is the process of **dividing a dataset into groups (clusters) based on similarity**. Each cluster contains data points that are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. It is used in customer segmentation, document classification, and genetic analysis.

#### **Example Use Case:**
Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.

#### **Common Clustering Algorithms:**
- **K-Means Clustering** – Partitions data into K clusters based on distance.
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – Builds a tree-like structure of clusters.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)** – Groups data based on density and identifies outliers.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** – Uses probability distributions for clustering.

### **2. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing Features While Retaining Essential Information**
Dimensionality reduction is used to **simplify high-dimensional data** while preserving important structures. It helps improve computational efficiency and visualization.

#### **Example Use Case:**
Reducing a dataset with 100 features to 10 key components for better interpretability.

#### **Common Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Projects data into fewer dimensions while retaining variance.
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** – Used for visualizing high-dimensional data.
- **Autoencoders** – Deep learning-based method for compressing and reconstructing data.

### **3. Anomaly Detection: Identifying Rare or Unusual Data Points**
Anomaly detection identifies **data points that significantly deviate from the norm**. It is widely used in fraud detection, cybersecurity, and medical diagnostics.

#### **Example Use Case:**
Detecting fraudulent transactions in banking data.

#### **Common Anomaly Detection Techniques:**
- **Isolation Forest** – Uses decision trees to separate anomalies.
- **One-Class SVM** – Finds a boundary around normal data and flags anomalies.
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** – Measures local density to identify anomalies.

### **4. Association: Discovering Rules That Explain How Features Are Related**
Association rule learning finds relationships between features in large datasets. It is commonly used in **market basket analysis** and **recommendation systems**.

#### **Example Use Case:**
Discovering that people who buy bread are likely to buy butter.

#### **Common Association Rule Learning Techniques:**
- **Apriori Algorithm** – Identifies frequent itemsets and generates rules.
- **FP-Growth Algorithm** – More efficient than Apriori for finding frequent patterns.

### **5. Density Estimation: Estimating the Probability Distribution of a Dataset**
Density estimation aims to model **the underlying distribution of data**. It is used in generative models and statistical analysis.

#### **Example Use Case:**
Estimating the probability of different income levels in a population.

#### **Common Density Estimation Techniques:**
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** – Uses Gaussian kernels to estimate probability density.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** – Represents data as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions.
